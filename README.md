## Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of stock market values using Spark Streaming to process and analyze stock data in real time. The goal is to extract actionable insights and understand market dynamics.

## User Guide
- Start by running the notebook “Kafka_Producer_for_Project” to initiate the stream.
- Update PySpark to version 3.5.0 before executing tasks.
- For each task in the main project notebook, run the “Pre-configuration” followed by the task itself. Restart the kernel for subsequent tasks.

## Tasks and Key Findings
- **Task 1**: Identifying the Most Valuable Stocks
- **Task 2**: Tracking Stocks That Lost Value
- **Task 3**: Identifying Stocks with Significant Gains
- **Task 4**: Control Check for Significant Value Loss
- **Task 5**: Asset Changes with the Fluctuation of the Market

## Technologies and Tools Used
- **Spark and PySpark**: For real-time data processing and analysis.
- **Spark SQL and DataFrames**: For data manipulation and analysis using Spark SQL functions and DataFrame operations.
- **User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: For specific processing requirements.
- **Data Types and Structured Streaming**: For handling real-time data efficiently.
